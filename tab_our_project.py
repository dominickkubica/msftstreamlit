                The Santa Clara University - Microsoft Practicum Project was established to compare various LLM's 
                and show their potential for financial sentiment analysis on earnings transcripts. We developed this tool 
                in conjunction with our findings, to showcase our methods of breaking down financial transcripts for sentiment 
                analysis. 
                
                The project addresses a crucial gap in financial analysis by automating the extraction of sentiment 
                signals from earnings calls and quantifying their relationship with market movements. Using natural 
                language processing and machine learning techniques, we've built a system that can:
                
                1. Process raw earnings call transcripts
                2. Identify sentiment patterns across different segments of the call
                3. Correlate these patterns with short-term stock price changes
                4. Visualize the results for intuitive understanding
                
                Our analysis provides unique insights into important market sectors that may drive stock movement. Although markets
                are tumultuous and unpredictable, our process highlights individual business lines that may be impacting investor sentiment
                with greater impact than others. We hope this tool can provide Microsoft with more information to better navigate the delicate 
                process of presenting quarterly earnings.

                Our project set out to benchmark large language models (LLMs) in their ability to perform financial sentiment analysis, comparing 
                their effectiveness against traditional machine learning methods using Python-based libraries.

                Our findings demonstrate that LLMs significantly outperform conventional models, particularly in capturing financial nuance and 
                contextual meaning within earnings transcripts.

                To validate these insights, we conducted a case study on Microsoft's last eight quarterly earnings calls, analyzing the sentiment 
                across business segments and correlating it with same-day stock performance. Our results suggest that certain divisions, such as Search tools and Reporter Q&A
                ,have a disproportionate impact on investor sentiment and price movement.

                To make this research actionable, we developed a user-friendly tool that automates this analysis. Users can upload an earnings transcript, 
                pair it with a relevant stock ticker, and receive targeted sentiment insights across business segments—highlighting which areas 
                may have driven investor reaction.
