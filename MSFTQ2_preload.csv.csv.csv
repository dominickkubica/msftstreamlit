"And lastly, we expect our Q3 
effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.",Gaming
"Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the 
fiscal year and beyond.",Gaming
"First, FX.",Gaming
"With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since October, we now expect FX to 
decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth 
by roughly one point.",Gaming
"Next, capital expenditures.",Gaming
We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend.,Gaming
"In FY '26, 
we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted 
backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud.",Gaming
"However, the 
growth rate will be lower than FY '25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived 
assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth.",Gaming
"As a reminder, our long-lived 
infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer 
demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud, including AI workloads.",Gaming
"As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the 
timing of delivery of finance leases.",Gaming
"For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit 
revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS 
and operating expense.",Gaming
"And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the 
year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI 
solutions, we now expect FY '25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year.",Gaming
"And finally, 
our FY '25 full-year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%.",Gaming
"In closing, we are committed to delivering real-world AI solutions to help customers grow and 
improve their results.",Gaming
"We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our 
customers.",Gaming
"Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you.",Gaming
"Brett Iversen is moving to a 
new role here as the Head of our Americas sales finance team.",Gaming
"On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leading Investor Relations for 
the past four years and for the partnership with both Satya and me.",Gaming
"And I'd like to welcome 
Jonathan Neilson, the former head of finance for our security products, who is returning to 
Investor Relations to lead the team.",Gaming
"With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.",Gaming
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Amy.",Gaming
We'll now move over to Q&A.,Gaming
"Out of respect for others on the call, we request that 
participants please only ask one question.",Gaming
"Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?",Gaming
"Questions & Answers: 
 
Operator 
Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with 
Morgan Stanley.",Gaming
Please proceed.,Gaming
"Keith Weiss -- Analyst 
Excellent.",Gaming
"Thank you, guys, for taking the question.",Gaming
"And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, 
congratulations on the new role.",Gaming
"It's been a pleasure working with you, and best of luck in that 
new role.",Gaming
"Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings.",Gaming
"But 
again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance 
range.",Server products and cloud services
"Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, 
what the resolution to those issues were.",Server products and cloud services
"And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into 
the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last 
quarter?",Server products and cloud services
Thank you very much.,Server products and cloud services
Amy E.,Server products and cloud services
"Hood -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer 
Thanks, Keith.",Office Commercial
"Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some 
additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about.",Office Commercial
"First, let me 
be very specific, they are in the non-AI ACR component.",Office Commercial
"Our Azure AI results were better than 
we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even 
by weeks.",Server products and cloud services
"When you're capacity-constrained, weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and 
you see that in the revenue results.",Server products and cloud services
"On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we 
call the scale motions.",Server products and cloud services
"So, think about primarily, these are customers we reach through partners 
and through more indirect methods of selling.",Server products and cloud services
"And really, the art form there is as these 
customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with 
continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took 
our sales motions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.",Server products and cloud services
"As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that 
balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and 
importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make 
those transitions.",Server products and cloud services
"And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in 
balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way 
through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, 
the teams are working through that.",Server products and cloud services
They're already making adjustments.,Server products and cloud services
"And I expect while we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through 
the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust.",Server products and cloud services
"I feel good that the teams understand 
and are working through that.",Server products and cloud services
"So, hopefully, that's just helpful on that.",Server products and cloud services
"Then we talked a little bit 
about Q3.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, we've talked about 31 to 32 after publishing a 31 this quarter.",Server products and cloud services
"Our AI results that we had 
felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same.",Server products and cloud services
"So, again, in Q3, 
we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place, and that's no different than it was our 
expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all.",Server products and cloud services
"And when I talk about 
being capacity-constrained, it takes two things.",Server products and cloud services
"You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right?",Server products and cloud services
"That's the infrastructure 
and the land and then you have to have kits.",Server products and cloud services
"We're continuing, and you've seen that's why our 
spend has pivoted this way, to be in the long-lived investment.",Server products and cloud services
"We have been short power and 
space.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, 
we get closer to that balance by the end of this year.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize, 
and be, I think, encouraged by the signals.",Server products and cloud services
"What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the 
non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2.",Server products and cloud services
"But in general, the only thing that's changed 
is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith.",Server products and cloud services
I hope that's helpful.,Server products and cloud services
Satya?,Server products and cloud services
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Yeah.",Office Commercial
"I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, AI growth rate 
is actually better than what we expected, and we worked through some of the supply stuff and 
more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well.",Office Commercial
"And when you look underneath any of 
these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio of even what we would call just 
regular storage, data services, app services.",Gaming
"So, underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even 
the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise, so that's all good.",Gaming
"The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, 
that's also in good shape.",Gaming
"And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, 
right, how do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?",Server products and cloud services
"At a time of platform shifts, you kind 
of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the 
stuff that you did in the previous generation.",Server products and cloud services
"And that's the art form Amy was referencing to, to 
make sure you get the right balance.",Server products and cloud services
But let me put it this way.,Server products and cloud services
You would rather win the new than just protect the past.,Server products and cloud services
"And that's sort of another thing that we 
definitely will lean into always.",Server products and cloud services
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Keith.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator, next question, please.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator 
The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.",Server products and cloud services
"Please 
proceed.",Server products and cloud services
"Mark Moerdler -- Analyst 
Thank you very much for taking my question.",Server products and cloud services
"Can you give more color on what drove the far 
larger-than-expected Microsoft AI revenue?",Server products and cloud services
We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it.,Server products and cloud services
But can you give more color on that?,Server products and cloud services
"And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger 
than we had expected and growing much faster.",Server products and cloud services
"Any more details on the breakdown of what 
that Microsoft AI beat would be great.",Server products and cloud services
Thanks.,Server products and cloud services
Amy E.,Server products and cloud services
"Hood -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer 
Thanks, Mark, for the question.",Office Commercial
"Yes, that was, as we talked about, better than expected.",Office Commercial
"A 
couple of pieces to that, which you correctly identified, number one is the Azure component we 
just talked about.",Server products and cloud services
"And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better.",Server products and cloud services
"And what was important about that, we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and 
expansion seats, as Satya talked about.",Server products and cloud services
"And usage doesn't directly impact revenue, but of 
course, indirectly does as people get more and more value added.",Server products and cloud services
"And also, price per seat was 
actually quite good.",Server products and cloud services
We still have a good signal for value.,Server products and cloud services
"So, those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our 
expectations.",Server products and cloud services
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thank you, Mark.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator, next question, please.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator 
The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.",Server products and cloud services
Please proceed.,Server products and cloud services
"Brent Thill -- Analyst 
Thanks.",Server products and cloud services
"Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks.",Server products and cloud services
"I think 
everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there.",Server products and cloud services
"And are we seeing AI scale 
now at a lower cost?",Server products and cloud services
Are we reaching a mark where you can see that?,Server products and cloud services
"Or do we still have some 
time to go?",Server products and cloud services
Thanks for your thoughts on this.,Server products and cloud services
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Yeah.",Office Commercial
"Thanks, Brent.",Office Commercial
"So, yeah, in my remarks, I talked about, in some sense, what's happening 
with AI.",Office Commercial
It's no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle.,Office Commercial
It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve.,Office Commercial
"So, there's 
Moore's Law that's working and hyperdrive.",Office Commercial
"Then on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, 
both the pretraining and the inference time compute that compound, and that's all software.",Office Commercial
"You 
should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on 
improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference.",Office Commercial
"And so, that's what you see.",Office Commercial
"And add to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations.",Office Commercial
And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in '01.,Office Commercial
"And so, we are going to -- 
obviously, now that all gets commoditized and it's going to get broadly used.",Office Commercial
"And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right?",Office Commercial
"Because at the 
end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to 
cloud?",Office Commercial
"More people bought servers, except it was called cloud.",Office Commercial
"And so, when token prices fall, 
inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more 
apps written.",Office Commercial
"And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty 
powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of '25, where on the PC, 
you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure.",Office Commercial
"So, that type of 
optimization means AI will be much more ubiquitous.",Office Commercial
"And so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news 
as far as I'm concerned.",Office Commercial
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Brent.",Office Commercial
"Operator, next question, please.",Office Commercial
"Operator 
The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.",Office Commercial
Please proceed.,Office Commercial
"Karl Keirstead -- Analyst 
Thank you.",Office Commercial
"Maybe this one is well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers.",Office Commercial
"But Satya, I 
wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI 
relationship last week.",Office Commercial
"It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, 
for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but electing to take more of a backseat 
in terms of funding OpenAI's future training capex needs.",Office Commercial
"I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether 
there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about 
capex needs over the next several years?",Office Commercial
Thank you.,Office Commercial
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Yeah.",Office Commercial
Thanks for the question.,Office Commercial
"So, we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI.",Office Commercial
"And 
as you saw, they have committed in a big way to Azure, and even in the bookings, what we 
recognized is just the first tranche of it.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, you'll see given the ROFR we have more benefits of that even into the future.",Server products and cloud services
"And 
obviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements 
that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement.",Server products and cloud services
"But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, 
right?",Server products and cloud services
We are making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference.,Server products and cloud services
"It's 
geo-distributed.",Server products and cloud services
"We are working super hard on all the software optimizations, right?",Server products and cloud services
"I mean, just not the software 
optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done 
to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI.",Server products and cloud services
"In 
fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it, and that's been key to driving, 
right?",Server products and cloud services
"One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model -- but if it's 
too expensive to serve, it's no good, right?",Server products and cloud services
It does -- it won't generate any demand.,Server products and cloud services
"So, you've 
got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be 
consumed broadly.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, that's the fleet physics we are managing.",Server products and cloud services
"And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the 
Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x.",Server products and cloud services
"You 
want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the 
day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as 
the training expense.",Server products and cloud services
"So, I feel very good about the investment we are making, and it's fungible, 
and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.",Server products and cloud services
Amy E.,Server products and cloud services
"Hood -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer 
And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on capex because I think 
it's helpful to ground a bit more in what Satya is saying, a fungible fleet means.",Office Commercial
"We have, and I 
think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO.",Office Commercial
"That is committed customer contracts that 
need to be delivered on.",Office Commercial
"And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, 
the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire 
platform that we need to deliver for our customers.",Office Commercial
"And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just 
the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference.",Office Commercial
"But there is some training 
post training, which is a key component.",Office Commercial
"And then they're just running the commercial cloud, 
which at every layer under every modern AI app that's going to be built will be required.",Office Commercial
"It will be 
required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global.",Office Commercial
And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient.,Office Commercial
"And 
so, the investment you see us make in capex, you're right, the front end has been this sort of 
infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but 
think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do 
on the commercial cloud side.",Office Commercial
And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU.,Office Commercial
"And that 
pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it will be contracted either with the partnership 
that you asked about with OpenAI or with others.",Office Commercial
"And so, I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the capex growth is going 
through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter 
who the end customer is.",Office Commercial
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Karl.",Office Commercial
"Operator, next question, please.",Office Commercial
"Operator 
And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.",Office Commercial
"Please 
proceed.",Office Commercial
"Brad Zelnick -- Analyst 
Thank you very much for taking my question.",Office Commercial
"And I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as 
well.",Office Commercial
"Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market 
for over a year with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference 
coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package 
and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer 
requirements out there?",Office Commercial
Thanks.,Office Commercial
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Well, thanks, Brad, for the question.",Office Commercial
"In fact, you saw us make two announcements recently.",Office Commercial
"One 
is on the M365 Copilot side, we now have the Copilot chat.",Office Commercial
"So, this is now going to be broadly 
deployed across the entire installed base effectively because you can go have this now turned 
on by IT and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right 
away, and it has Copilot Studio built in.",Office Commercial
"And so, that means they can start building agents.",Office Commercial
"So, we think of that plus the full Copilot as a 
good combination that I think will accelerate, quite frankly, in terms of just seat usage and agent 
building and what have you.",Office Commercial
"So, that's sort of one.",Office Commercial
"And the other thing is you also see, even on 
the consumer side, we just, yesterday, launched one -- or the ThinkHarder feature on Copilot 
now that's powered by o1.",Office Commercial
"It's available globally, right?",Office Commercial
"So, you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost 
coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of 
premium tier, and that's all definitely something that we will do across, right?",Office Commercial
"The same thing is 
happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in security Copilot.",Server products and cloud services
"So, across the length and breadth 
of our portfolio, you'll see that.",Server products and cloud services
"Brad Zelnick -- Analyst 
Thank you.",Server products and cloud services
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Brad.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator, next question, please.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator 
The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.",Server products and cloud services
Please proceed.,Server products and cloud services
"Brad Reback -- Analyst 
That's great.",Server products and cloud services
Thank you very much.,Server products and cloud services
"Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what 
percent of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models?",Server products and cloud services
"And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day?",Server products and cloud services
Thanks.,Server products and cloud services
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Yeah.",Office Commercial
"It's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of 
models that get used in any application, right?",Office Commercial
"When you look underneath even a Copilot or a 
GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models.",Server products and cloud services
"You build 
models, you fine-tune models, you distill models.",Server products and cloud services
"Some of them are models that you distill into 
an open-source model.",Server products and cloud services
"So, there's going to be a combination.",Server products and cloud services
"So, we've always maintained that it's always good to 
have frontier models.",Server products and cloud services
"You want to always build your application with high ambition using the 
best. model that is available and then optimize from there on.",Server products and cloud services
"So, that's also another side.",Server products and cloud services
"Like there's a temporality to it, right?",Server products and cloud services
"What you start with as a given 
COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and 
COGS and putting in different models.",Server products and cloud services
"And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be 
managed by a new app server.",Server products and cloud services
"So, one of the things that we are investing heavily on is foundry 
because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with this flurry of 
models that are coming in, and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to 
benefit from all that innovation, but not have all the dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people 
talk about AIOps cost.",Server products and cloud services
"So, we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit 
from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes, and at the 
same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.",Server products and cloud services
"Brad Reback -- Analyst 
Great.",Server products and cloud services
Thank you.,Server products and cloud services
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Brad.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator, next question, please.",Server products and cloud services
"Operator 
And the next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.",Server products and cloud services
Please proceed.,Server products and cloud services
"Brad Sills -- Analyst 
Wonderful.",Server products and cloud services
Thank you so much.,Server products and cloud services
Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot.,Server products and cloud services
Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength.,Server products and cloud services
"Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybe 
multiple departmental deals in the enterprise?",Server products and cloud services
And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends.,Server products and cloud services
"Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you 
that confidence that that will ramp into monetization later.",Server products and cloud services
Thank you.,Server products and cloud services
"Satya Nadella -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
Yeah.",Office Commercial
"I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in 
immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance, or in supply chain where there is a lot of, like, 
for example, SharePoint grounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web 
data and have it produce results that are beneficial.",Office Commercial
"But then what's happening very much like 
what we have seen in these previous generation productivity things is that people collaborate 
across functions, across roles, right?",Office Commercial
"For example, even in my own daily habit, I go to chat.",Office Commercial
"I use 
work tab and get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues.",Office Commercial
I sort of call it think with AI and work with people.,Office Commercial
"And that pattern then requires you to make it 
more of a standard issue across the enterprise.",Office Commercial
"And so, that's what we're seeing.",Office Commercial
"It starts maybe 
at a departmental level.",Office Commercial
"Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across.",Office Commercial
"You 
can do it by cohort and what have you.",Office Commercial
"And so, what we've made it easier even is to start with 
Copilot Chat plus this.",Office Commercial
"And so, that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have 
something that's more ubiquitous.",Office Commercial
"Brad Sills -- Analyst 
Wonderful.",Office Commercial
Thank you so much.,Office Commercial
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Brad.",Office Commercial
"Operator, we have time for one last question.",Office Commercial
"Operator 
And the last question will come from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.",Office Commercial
"Please 
proceed.",Office Commercial
"Brent Bracelin -- Analyst 
Thank you for taking the question here.",Office Commercial
Good afternoon.,Office Commercial
"I wanted to go back to commercial 
bookings.",Office Commercial
"Commercial RPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially.",Office Commercial
"That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial bookings growth, 75% 
constant currency.",Office Commercial
That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade.,Office Commercial
"I appreciate there's 
some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter, there was a bit of a sea change 
relative to momentum on backlog and bookings.",Office Commercial
"Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of 
where that strength came from?",Office Commercial
Was it broad-based?,Office Commercial
Was there a couple of large deals?,Office Commercial
"Any 
color there would be helpful.",Office Commercial
Thanks.,Office Commercial
Amy E.,Office Commercial
"Hood -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer 
Thanks, Brent.",Office Commercial
It's a great question.,Office Commercial
"We talked a little bit about one of the main drivers, which 
was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made.",Server products and cloud services
"And I do want to say, while that is 
obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitments.",Server products and cloud services
"So, I don't -- I want to separate the concept that it's one-time versus an ongoing relationship that 
will grow as they grow, which it absolutely will.",Server products and cloud services
"And to your question on what else is participating 
in that number.",Server products and cloud services
"First, we did have very good core motions.",Server products and cloud services
"Our core motions are things like, to 
your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-ons to those contracts, upsells, like, for 
example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes.",Server products and cloud services
And I think that's important.,Server products and cloud services
"We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about 
M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about Suite momentum, and we saw that as well 
this quarter, which we felt very good about.",Server products and cloud services
"And then the final component is large Azure 
commitments.",Server products and cloud services
"And those really did look as we expected, which is good.",Server products and cloud services
"To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth.",Server products and cloud services
"Those Azure commitments 
take two forms.",Server products and cloud services
"One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are 
making larger commitments, which is a good commitment signed for the platform.",Server products and cloud services
"And then you 
have new customers making commitments, and we also saw that this quarter.",Server products and cloud services
"And so, to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's 
just one thing.",Server products and cloud services
I think you're right.,Server products and cloud services
"Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution 
consistently across the workloads.",Server products and cloud services
"Brent Bracelin -- Analyst 
Thank you.",Server products and cloud services
"Brett Iversen -- Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Brent.",Server products and cloud services
That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.,Server products and cloud services
"Thank you for joining us 
today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.",Server products and cloud services
